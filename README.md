## About The App

The main thing that this app does is fetch data from pokeapi.co and using that data we display cards with informations about the loaded pokemons, you can see general information about the pokemon on the preview card in the home page, but clicking on it takes you to another page where you can see more details about the pokemon. Some other functionalities the app has are: Searching through the pokemon results, filtering the pokemons by type. The UI has been made using the component library Chakra UI.
